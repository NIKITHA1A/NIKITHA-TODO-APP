Todo Application – React Frontend
 Project Overview

This project is a Todo Application Frontend developed using React (Functional Components and Hooks). The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks through full CRUD operations integrated with a backend API.

The application demonstrates modern React development practices including state management with hooks, API integration, and dynamic UI rendering.

 Features

View Todos – Displays a list of all existing tasks retrieved from the backend.

Add Todo – Users can create a new task using an input field.

Update Todo – Inline editing functionality allows modification of existing tasks.

Mark as Complete/Incomplete – Users can toggle the completion status of a task.

Delete Todo – Tasks can be removed from the list instantly.

Dynamic UI Updates – The interface updates automatically after every operation.

 Technologies Used

React JS

Functional Components

React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Axios for API communication

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML & CSS (Basic Styling)

 Application Architecture

The frontend communicates with a backend REST API using Axios for performing CRUD operations:

GET /todos – Fetch all todos

POST /todos – Create a new todo

PUT /todos/:id – Update an existing todo

DELETE /todos/:id – Remove a todo

State management is handled using React hooks to ensure smooth and responsive UI updates.

 Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate:

Understanding of React functional components

Effective use of React Hooks

REST API integration

Conditional rendering

State-driven UI updates

Clean and maintainable frontend structure

 Output

The application displays a simple and intuitive interface consisting of:

A title header

Input field with Add button

A structured list of tasks

Edit, Delete, and Complete/Incomplete controls for each task

 Conclusion

This project showcases practical implementation of frontend development concepts using React. It follows modern best practices and provides a strong foundation for building scalable and interactive web applications.
