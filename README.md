Todo Full Stack Application
 Project Description

The Todo Full Stack Application is a web-based task management system that enables users to perform complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on daily tasks. The project demonstrates integration between a React-based frontend and a RESTful backend API.

This application is designed following modern development practices, ensuring clean architecture, component-based design, and seamless client-server communication.

Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

🔹 Frontend

Developed using React JS

Built with Functional Components and Hooks

Uses Axios for API communication

Implements dynamic rendering and state management

🔹 Backend

RESTful API implementation

Handles CRUD operations for todos

Connects to a database for persistent storage (if configured)


 Features

View Todos – Displays a list of all existing tasks retrieved from the backend.

Add Todo – Users can create a new task using an input field.

Update Todo – Inline editing functionality allows modification of existing tasks.

Mark as Complete/Incomplete – Users can toggle the completion status of a task.

Delete Todo – Tasks can be removed from the list instantly.

Dynamic UI Updates – The interface updates automatically after every operation.

 Technologies Used

React JS

Functional Components

React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Axios for API communication

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML & CSS (Basic Styling)

 Application Architecture

The frontend communicates with a backend REST API using Axios for performing CRUD operations:

GET /todos – Fetch all todos

POST /todos – Create a new todo

PUT /todos/:id – Update an existing todo

DELETE /todos/:id – Remove a todo

State management is handled using React hooks to ensure smooth and responsive UI updates.

 Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate:

Understanding of React functional components

Effective use of React Hooks

REST API integration

Conditional rendering

State-driven UI updates

Clean and maintainable frontend structure

 Output

The application displays a simple and intuitive interface consisting of:

A title header

Input field with Add button

A structured list of tasks

Edit, Delete, and Complete/Incomplete controls for each task

 Conclusion

This project provides a complete implementation of a full-stack Todo application and serves as a foundational example of modern web development using React and RESTful APIs.
